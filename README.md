You will need to install python (system python usually don't work) and several python libraries. asdf
One way to go is to install everything with [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html). 
Never tried, but it is a well-maintained project and it includes everything you can imagine.

The other way is to install everything manually. I prefer installing python via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), 
since it is a fork of rbenv project which should be familiar to any ruby developer.
